# CAMERA BUILD OBJECTIVES

Since my girlfriend gave me a Kodak Brownie Flash II, I have been thinking on how I could make that camera better. I love the simiplicity it has, but some times, it is a bit frustrating not to be able to choose shutter speed or focus. As you may know, most (if not all) cameras are:

* Fix focus
* Fix F number
* Fix shutter speed

I wanted to improve that desing by attaching a normal Brownie camera another leaf shutter lens, but in the end, I found out easier to made my own body specifically for the lens I would bought.

## PROJECT MAIN OBJECTIVES

* Create an affordable Brownie-type camera
* It must be made out of 3D printed parts
* All the parts must be designed and 3D printed in home for lower expenses (all but the lens)
* Picture quality must be high 
* Operability must be easy and intuitive
* Lens must include a shutter leaf
* Lens must include focus hellicoid - easier design

## PROJECT STAGES

* Preliminary design (sketch) 
* Lens of choice
* CAD design of camera components
* 3D-Printed parts and correction of issues
* Check for correct focus
* Maiden film test
* Film development to search for possible leaks
* Future iterations

### PRELIMINARY DESIGN (SKETCH)

Preliminary design was performed on a sheet and based on other wide format cameras, such as Pinholes and Kodak Brownie. Evidently it is just a sketch of what could be, when the CAD design process starts, the design will be modified affected mainly to make it printable.

This is the first 120 format camera I've made. Brownie-based that I ended up calling "Celiwonie". I made it for my girlfriend, whose name is Celia, and hence the name of the camera. The only difference with the common Brownie is that in this case, this is not a 6x9 format, but 6x6. 

Bellow it is possible to see some pictures of the design I made using Solid Edge CAD programming software. 

### LENS OF CHOICE

Selecting the proper lens is not an easy task. A lot of things must be taken into account. For example, focal length, top shutter speed, max F-Number and of course glass quality, in my project I also needed the focus hellicoid built-in the lens body. This would make the design much simpler in termns of CAD, becasuse there would be no need to design a 3D-Printed hellicoid.

Since I did not want to spend a large amount of money, I started looking for medium format 6x6 and 6x9 cameras, I did not care about the cosmetic state of the camera itself, since I only wanted the lens, I did not even care if the camera was working, I only wanted the shutter. This is how I found the camera I ended up buying, a Zeiss-Ikkon Nettar, with a 75mm F8 lens.

This is not the best lens in the world, but in my opinion is pretty sharp and contrasty for its price and size. Main characteristics may be seen in table attached below for your own information.

### CAD DESIGN OF CAMERA COMPONENTS

This step is the top time consuming one, in order to make everything perfectly fit, it will be necessary to make several print attemps. If it is your idea to built one for yourself, beware that it is a time consuming project and many times it is not rewarding at all. In my case, Celiownie was made up by 4 pieces, render pictures of them maybe seen below. Ig you want the STL files, do not hesitate to ask for them, either in comments section or by filling-up the contact form. 

Anyway, keep in mind that my STL files, only work for my lens and film configuration, if, for example, you want to make a 35mm film camera, you will need to adapt the film carriers to fit a 35mm roll. If your lens is not the same focal length you will also need to redesign the case for a proper focus. This post is then a roadmap on the necessary steps, and the problems you may face during the process of desgining your own camera. 

Design phase was really easy, I had to make several changes, but most of them were solved before the first prototype print, to be sincere, only the winding knob had to be printed more than once. And it was due to an issue in the printing phase. I encourage you to make a an assembly of the camera at the same time you are designing them, and take a look at it from time to time, so you will notice if somethig does not fit properly in your assembly before printing, belive me, it has saved me some lost time.

### 3D-PRINTED PARTS



### CHECK FOR CORRECT FOCUS

Checking that calculated flange distance is correct and that the image will be sharp in the film is, at least for me, the most important step at the time of building a camera. For this task, what I usually do is the following (I also do this when I disassemble a lens, in order to check that all the elements have been mounted in the correct way. Yes, it happenened to me in the past with a 6x9 Kodak Junior..).

For these I have based the process on Ground-glass cameras, I attach a Negative-size piece of grease-proof paper on the back of the camera (where the negative should be). I turn off the lights and show a picture in my monitor or open the courtain a bit enough for the lens to see the outside. I focus to infinity, select "B" speed, cock and by means of a release cable, release and keep pushed to keep the shutter open.

At the same time, I use a bridge camera that I have in macro mode and take a snapshot of the image projected in the paper (this image must be upside down, it is normal). Later in the computer, I check that far away buildings are correctly in focus. If this test is positive, then your flange distance is fine and you can continue with the printing process, if not, you will have to remake some pieces and find our where you can put or take out material.

This step should not be very hard to pass on, nevertheless I encourage you to make it before you have printed all the pieces that make up the camera. And hence if something is wrong you won't have to reprint everything, just redesign the necessary parts and it will be fine! Once you've checked infinity, it is also advisory to check other in-range distances (1m, 2m, etc.) if possible.

### MAIDEN FILM TEST

Once you've checked your focus and checked that everything assembles fine, it is time to make the first test. It is important not to decorate your camera yet. The tests could go wrong in terms of light leaks, film not adavancing correctly, or many other points which could actually go wrong. There's still room for improvement. Be patient, that is my advice.

If everything goes fine, which is something very rare, then you can think of decorating your custom camera. Congratulations! 

### ISSUES FOUND DURING MAIDEN TEST

In my case, this camera was a present, and the issues I found could be easily improved with the camera even decorated, and so that is what I did. The issues I found are the following:

* The film advance was not easy. (This will be fixed with a redesign wheel knob)
* Film felt to be not tight inside the camera. (this will be fixed with a new pressing plate)
* Film tighten issue caused a loss in focus and perspective weird look

### RESULTS OBTAINED

To this time, I have only made one roll of film on that camera. The results have been very good. Nevertheless I could find some issues which I noted above and you may see on the pictures attached below.
