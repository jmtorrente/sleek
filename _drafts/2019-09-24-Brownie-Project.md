# BROWNIE IQ PROJECT:
 <p align="justify">
    The scope of this project is to be able to gain some control over old cameras like the Kodak Brownie Flash II. Kodak Brownie II is a very cheap and simple film camera with a fixed focal lens, fix focus, fixed F number and only one shutter speed. 
    <br/><br/>
    Let's got over the main characteristics of this camera:
    <br/><br/>
    * Lens: 1 + 1 element fixed focus (with a second lens for close-ups).
    * Focal Length: Supposely around 100mm.
    * Shutter speed: 1/50th of a second. Bulb mode available.
    * Aperture: Fix aperture F11.
    * Film: 620 film (it is possible to fit 120 forcing a little).
    <br/><br/>
    There is not focus feedback and the photo is composed by means of two small mirrors. for vertical and horizontal composition.

## FIRST APPROACH
 <p align="justify">
    The first approach is also the most complex one. It includes the use of an electromagnetic shutter. It is not easy to get the right electromagnetic shutter, and so, it will be necessary to do some investigation. Aliexpress sells some small versions  which may be useful, at least for tests, but there is no datasheet and no information about fastest opssible speed or such. It is cheap, but anyway a blind bought, this approach may be tested in coming posts.

## SECOND APPROACH
<p align="justify">
    the second approach is a bit less optimistic and in some way reachable. If the first approach does not work (and anyway), we will try to couple an old camera shutter (leaf shutter) to a Brownie-kind body. This seems easy and straightforward, nevertheless it's got some difficulties which will be worked out later in this or coming posts.
    <br/><br/>
    I guess that if I detached the current lens of the Kodak Brownie, and attached on its place my old Wollensak central shutter, I could better test if it actually works or creates some vignetting on the negative. Puting both cameras side by side I can say that it should be fine.
    <br/><br/>
    The problem of this second approach is to find out the flange distance of the central shutter used for this project. Flange distance (Fig. 3) of a camera system is the distance from the lens coupling ring to the negative or digital sensor. This distance depends on the camera used, usually flange distance keeps the same between different cameras of the same format in a brand, but it is different between different brands. For example flange distance on an APS-C Canon DSLR is 44.0 mm while Nikon equivalent is 46,5mm. This is usually done to unable the use of different brand lenses with one same body.

## THIRD APPROACH
<p align="justify">
    Nevertheless, it also exists another approach. I think that it is possible to create a camera just by myself. It is something that i have always wanted to do. It is not an easy task and involves high amounts of work and design.
   <br/><br/>
    For such a project, it is necessary to use a design software like solid edge, for example and of course, a 3D printer will also be necessary in order to print the necessary parts and finally Evidently a lens and shutter will be needed, and for this, I had already bought a cheap camera to remove the lens. It had to be a leaf-shutter, since no courtain is available in this camera.
    The camera chosen for this task is a Zeiss Ikon Nettar 517/16 with a 75mm F6.3. With a speed range from Bulb to 1/200". It is not the best lens available. But this is a test project, and it is not necessary to make it more expensive, if it works. In the future, it will be possible to add new lenses and addons.

### INSPIRATION

I always wanted to build and design my own camera, but when I started to think about it, it always felt out of my reach. I felt not prepared to perform this task. My idea was always to try to build a camera similar to the hasselblad XPan, bacause I like the concept of having a panoramic camera and the ones available are very expensive, and hence, out of my reach.

I then started to think about an easy project, one based on a simple camera, I the inspiration came to my mind. I remembered the Kodak Brownie Flash Ii which you, Celia, gave to me two years ago. Do not missunderstand me, the Kodak Brownie is a great camera, but I wanted to make it a little better, as it is, it has a fix speed, fix focus and focal length lens.I wanted to make a Brownie 2.0. Which I called a Celiownie.
