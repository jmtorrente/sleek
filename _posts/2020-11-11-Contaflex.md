# ZEISS IKON CONTAFLEX SUPER

During pandemy times, one of my work colleagues contacted me about this camera. He had found two cameras during a cleanup inside a flat who belonged to a person diagnosed with Diogenes syndrome. In the begining I was not eager to go ahead and make him an offer. Finally I ended up buying them.

My colleague contacted me to figure out if there was anything he could get for that camera, he knew that vintage cameras prices are rising and so, he wanted to make some profit out of it. 

As I said, I did not want to buy any camera, I had recently bought a Bronica ETRS and my GAS (Gear Acquisition Syndrome) was already fed for that month. That meaning, I was only buying it for the right price, I then checked that camera on the internet and look at Mckewon camera prices guide.
I found out that this camera is worth something around 100€ in mint state. Anyway, since I was willing to make him an offer without physically seeing and testing it, I was not going anything above 20€, which I think was a right price for an untested camera.

For the price I paid, I was willing to take the risk for the camera not working or requiring lots of work for it to be in good shape. I usually buy cameras in websites like: ebay, catawiki, wallapop and such, and sadly, I am kind of used to that adverts like: "in perfect condition", "works as new" and others alike, and so, I am not willing to buy a camera which I don't know the state of and can't test nyself before.

Once I got the camera, I performed the same procedures I take with all the cameras I have:

* Basic tests: cocking, shutter, speeds and cosmetic state
* Cleaning and desinfection with alcohol and dedicated products, water and soap (depending on the surface)
* Lens cleaning (if there is fungus, I use vinegar)
* If needed lubrication (sometimes requires dismanteling the camera) and seal replacemnent
* Test roll
* Development and scanning

With this camera I will affirm that I have been lucky, This contaflex has actually surprised me in the good way. Not only it was in a fairly good cosmetic condition, but evertything looked to work fine, something that I wasn't expecting knowing the age and where the camera was found.

Zeiss Ikon Contaflex super camera was first introduced in 1959. It was manufactured in Zeiss Ikon AG factory located in Stuttgart. The factory was perviously established in Dresden, but after WWII, that factory dawned to be pentacon: the unification of Pentagon, a pentaprism manufacturer and Contax, brand of Zeiss Ikon group.

My first impression when I grabbed the camera, was that it was very heavy. It weights around (mirar el peso) kg but it impresses even more given its reduced size. It is clear that this camera is completely made of steel.

Contruction quality is great. It has a coupled selenium exposure meter located on the front side of the prism, the exposure can be adjusting by turning the aperture setting wheel located on the front plate (upper right corner), in order to get an accurate measurement, the ISO is easily adjusted inside the aperture setting wheel, DIN standard only, from 10 to 33.

The meters match needle is visible from the viewfinder as well as on the top plate. I compared it with a modern light meter and my impression is that is not very accurate nowadays, this is something very normal for a camera of this age.

Film advance lever feels solid, in my particular model, it feels like if it did not adavance progressivley, not that it feels like breaking, but it invites you to treat it with caution. 

Film advance lever contains the Frame counter, it is not automatic and it must be set to one of the two starting marks engraved on it depending on the if the roll is 24 or 36 exposures. It works in a detrimental way showing how many shots are lefton your roll. My experience with this frame counters is that I always forget to reset it, and when I realise, it is useless. 

__Film__ rewind knob impresses for its elegance. It is a complex, yet easy knob. Complex because it involves a film type, DIN number indicator and rewind knob in the same wheel, as the whole camera, it feels very sturdy and it makes film rewind loveable.

The top plate also includes a cold shoe.

Shutter speed and focus are all set on the lens. it is not an ergonomic masterpiece, and I find it quite complicated to operate the camera when taking pictures, even thoug, the speed knob has two black levers, but they are bulky and hard to operate because they hit every other time the focus levers.

As I could see in the camera manual, this camera is designed to be operated with both hands at the same time, but I am sorry Zeiss, I am not used to do so and I also found it not very friendly in that way.

On the other hand, there is one thing that may be loved or hated. Aperture and shutter speeds are coupled, that means, that you only have to set the aperture (aperture wheel in the front plate) following the light meter, and then move the shutter speed ring until desired speed is chosen.

You may still work the exposure manually, but certain times, when the aperture wheel is not in the right place, the speed ring on the lens may be quite hard to move. I particularly don't like it, I prefer other systems which allows to decoupling them like in other systems.

However there are many lights too in this camera. the viewfinder is very bright and includes a split image rangefinder for focusing tasks. Focusing, as I have already said, is not an easy task but because of the way it needs to be performed, with two fingers and two hands instead of a more usual and ergonomic one complete hand of most modern SLR and rangefinders.

But it does not end yet. This camera is very special. It does not look like that, but it includes interchangeable lenses, something that at first glance you would not beleive. the system is a bit different to what we are used to in the sense that: all lenses take advantage of two lens elements which sit inside the lens barell,a dn so, they are lighter and shorter.

What I mean, is that it is different to a common SLR in which the whole lens, with focus hellicoid an aperture blades is changed, in this case it is only a part of it, and so 50mm for example is as tiny as it can be seen in picture below.

This camera may be completed with any of the following lenses:

* Carl Zeiss Tessar 50mm, F2.8
* Carl Zeiss Pro-Tessar 85mm, F4
* Carl Zeiss Pro-Tessar 35mm, F4
* Carl Zeiss Stereocope lens
* Other Proxar lenses for close-ups

But party mode does not end here. Do you like film backs? Like those found on Hasselblads, kiev88, bronicas ETRS or other systems, they allow the user to have two or more different films (for example one colour and one black and white) ready to shoot and exchange at any time as desired. Well, I had seen medium format cameres which had them, but I think that this Contaflex is the first 35mm film camera that has this possibility.

# EASTER EGG

When the camera arrived, I tried to cock and shoot it and I played with the shutter speed ring. My appreciation was that the cocking mechanism felt a bit hard and tough to actuate, in the begggining I tought that the camera had some kind of lubrication issue. I left it aside waiting for its turn in the repairing queue.

One night, thinking about this camera, I realized that I've already felt this behavior on another camera, a Zorki-1 that had a roll inside (and undeveloped). So, there was a chance for a roll of film to be inside this camera, and that is why it was tough to cock. My suspicions were confirmed the following day when I cocked the camera and saw the rewind knob moving, a clear sign of a film roll (or other thing) inside.

It was a very weird and old roll, it was manufactured or sold from a company called "corp99" from Catalunya that closed a long time ago, it has 12 exposures, and I think it is color film. I say I think, because it does not have any labeling about it or about the development process.

# CONCLUSION

This Zeiss Ikon Contaflex Super, is a very heavy and sturdy camera. I think it is a complicated and slow camera to shoot with and obviously I would not recommend it if you are thinking about street photography. On the other hand it is a quite special and interesnting camera since it has interchageable lenses (only part of the lens) and film backs.

# SAMPLE PHOTOS

The sample photos you see below were shot on Christmas 2020 in Madrid, the film is a bulk loaded canister of HP5 forced to ISO 3200, developed at home in a semi-stand development with the following characteristics:

* Rodinal 1:100 dilution
* Constant agitation for the first minute
* Four inversions at 30' mark
* End of development after 60' mark

Turns out, even though, semi-stand development and Rodinal together are supposed to boost the film grain, the results of this HP5+ @3200 ISO has delivered a consisting grain and good contrast.
