# PANORAMIC CAMERA BUILD:

For several years I have been thinking about panoramic cameras. I love them, I know that taking good pictures with them takes time in order to get used to that format, but I have been very eager to get one. Obviously I would love to have a Hasselblad X-Pan, but leaving my parents home and starting a new life with my girlfriend is leaving me broke, and even if I were not in that situation, I think that I would not spend 3 000 € or more on a single camera.

A cheaper option could be the russian Horizon camera, made by Zenit is one of the cheapest options to get into panoramic photos in 35mm, nevertheless, I think it is actually a expensive camera, a good one is over 300 €, for the quality of the body and the images obtained from it. Not to talk about the deformation of the picture, caused by the rotating lens. But I guess that it is a fine camera if you want to play that game.

So, for a long time, I have been thinking about what is the best option, and in the end, I ended up thinking that I could create a much better camera than the goddish X-Pan... Something bigger and with more quality (in terms of image-quality). So investigating, I found the Fuji GSW 617, which takes 120 film and created images up to 6x17. the lens that it uses is a shutter leaf large format lens called Fujinon 90 mm SWD, which is a lens built for wide pictures.

## PROJECT MAIN OBJECTIVES:

* Create an affordable panoramic camera
* It must be made out of 3D printed parts
* All the parts must be designed and 3D printed in home for lower expenses
* Picture quality must be high
* Operability must be easy and intuitive
* Lens must include a shutter leaf
* Focus will be fixed to infinity (at the begining)
* A second iteration of the camera will have focus ring 

## PROJECT STAGES:

* Preliminary design (sketch) 
* Buy Fujinon lens
* CAD design of camera components
* 3D-Printing parts and correction of issues
* Check infinity focus
* Maiden film test
* Film development to search for possible leaks

### PRELIMINARY DESIGN (SKETCH):

Preliminary design was performed on a sheet and based on other wide format cameras, such as Pinholes, Fuji GSW 617 or Horseman 617. Evidently it is just a sketch of what could be, when the CAD design process starts, the design will be modified affected mainly to make it printable.

This is not the first 120 format camera I made, the first one was a Brownie based one which was called Celiwonie. I made it for my girlfriend, whose name is Celia, and hence the name of the camera. The only difference with the common Brownie is that in this case, this is not a 6x9 format, but 6x6. You can se more information about that project on the following link: Celiwonie 6x6 Brownie-based Camera.
