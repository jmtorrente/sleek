    This photo was shot in Galicia, in a not very remote area not far from Padr√≥n. Fina is a good and old friend of my family. She is not actually my family from name. But this fact does not mean anything for people like her. 

    I will always remember Fina's potatoes, I will always remember Fina's laugh and workaholism. She is one of the most laborous person I now. She posed for my picture in front of the house wehere she's lived for the last 30 years or so, during my holiday period in 2022.

    Fina used to live in a small house next to my grandfather's family house. She used to spent endless hours playing cards with my grandparents in our family house, an activity that I've been told, they loved.
