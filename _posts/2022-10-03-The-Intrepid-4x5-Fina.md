This photo was shot in Galicia, in a remote area not far from Padr√≥n.

Fina is a good and old friend of my family. She is not actually my family from name. Butthis fact does not mean anything for people like her. 

I will always remember Fina's potatoes, I will always remember Fina's laugh and workaholism.She is one of the bussiest person I know. 

During my 2022 holiday period. She posed in front of her house, where she's lived for aboutthe last 30 years. Fina used to live in a small house next to my family house. She used to spent endless hours playing cards with my grandparents in our family house, an activity that I've been told, they loved.
